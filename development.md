home page to gather some links together. 
created using the gatsby static site generator. 

## ðŸš€ Quick start

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

  
  make sure you're on the master branch before you deploy 

  usually I kill the master branch, then cut a new branch from develop, then deploy 
  `git br -D master`
  `git co -b master`
  
  Deploy using
  `npm run deploy`
